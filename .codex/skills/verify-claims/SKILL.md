description: Run Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) on a draft or a block of text with factual claims. Spawns the `claim-verifier` agent in a forked (fresh) context so it never sees the draft — then reports which claims are supported, contradicted, or unverifiable. Use when user says "verify these citations", "check the claims in X", "did I hallucinate anything", "fact-check this draft", "run CoVe on this", or after any text generation that asserts facts about papers, datasets, or numerical results. NOT for style/grammar review (use `/proofread`) or substance review (use `/review-paper`).

# /verify-claims — Chain-of-Verification on a Draft

Fact-check a draft using the **Post-Flight Verification protocol** ([`.codex/rules/post-flight-verification.md`](../../rules/post-flight-verification.md)).

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` — path to a file containing the draft (markdown, .qmd, .tex, .md) or a shorthand pointer. Optional flags:

- `--source <path-or-url>` — one or more source-material pointers (repeat for multiple). If omitted, the skill infers from context (e.g., papers referenced, cited arXiv URLs).
- `--no-fail-closed` — downgrade FAIL outcomes to warnings without regeneration. Use sparingly.

## When to pick this skill

- **`/verify-claims`** (this skill) — ad-hoc fact-checking on any draft or text block the user hands you. One-shot, user-invoked.
- **Other skills that auto-run Post-Flight internally** (`/lit-review`, `/research-ideation`, `/respond-to-referees`, `/review-paper --peer`) — no need to call this separately; they already run it.
- **`/proofread`** — grammar, typos, overflow. Different lens.
- **`/review-paper`** (default mode) — full manuscript review, not just claim verification.

## How it works

Implements the 4-step CoVe loop from Dhuliawala et al. 2023 ([arXiv:2309.11495](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495)), with architectural enforcement of the fresh-context independence trick.

### Phase 0 — Pre-Flight

Confirm:
- Draft file exists and is readable
- At least one source pointer available (either `--source` or auto-detected from draft)
- `claim-verifier` agent file exists at `.codex/agents/claim-verifier.md`

If any fail → surface the failure, do NOT proceed.

### Phase 1 — Extract claims

Read the draft. Identify factual assertions of these types:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Citation | "Smith (2019, *JEL*) shows X" |
| Numerical fact | "N = 10,000", "ATT = 0.42" |
| Negative literature | "No prior work studies X" |
| Named entity | researcher, paper title, venue, package, estimator name |
| Dataset claim | "The CPS contains field `educ_attain`" |

Skip: opinions, forward-looking suggestions, definitions the draft introduces.

Output a claims table:

```markdown
| ID | Claim | Source hint |
|----|-------|-------------|
| C1 | ... | ... |
```

### Phase 2 — Generate verification questions

One question per claim. Make it specific and answerable from the source alone.

### Phase 3 — Spawn `claim-verifier` (forked, fresh context)

```
Task: subagent_type=claim-verifier, context=fork
Prompt: hand over claims table + verification questions + source material pointers.
        Do NOT include the draft text.
```

The forked agent runs the CoVe independent-answer step. It has never seen the draft and cannot confirm-bias. It returns a structured verification report.

### Phase 4 — Reconcile

Based on the report:

- **PASS** (all claims match source): produce a green Post-Flight block and return.
- **PARTIAL** (unverifiable claims remain): produce a yellow block flagging which claims need manual review.
- **FAIL** (at least one contradiction): produce a red block listing discrepancies with evidence. If the draft is writeable and the user asked for auto-correction, regenerate the affected sections using the verifier's evidence. Otherwise return the report and let the user decide.

Respect `--no-fail-closed`: on FAIL, produce the warning but do not regenerate.

## Example

```
/verify-claims quality_reports/lit-review_staggered-did.md --source master_supporting_docs/callaway_santanna_2021.pdf --source master_supporting_docs/dechaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_2020.pdf
```

Expected output (abridged):

```markdown
## Post-Flight Verification — lit-review_staggered-did.md

**Claims extracted:** 14
**Verified independently:** 14 (forked claim-verifier)
**Outcome:** PARTIAL — 12 verified, 1 discrepancy, 1 unverifiable

### Discrepancies

- **C7** — draft claims "de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfœuille (2020) *propose* a DR estimator." Source Section 4 shows they propose a weighting estimator, not DR. Recommend correction.

### Unverifiable

- **C12** — draft cites "Borusyak et al. 2024 (working paper)". No canonical URL in provided sources. Recommend user supply DOI or arXiv link.

### Verified

| ID | Claim | Evidence |
|----|-------|----------|
| C1 | "Callaway & Sant'Anna 2021 use group-time ATT" | p. 5, eq. (3) |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

## Fail modes and recovery

**Verifier times out:** surface a warning block, return draft as provisional. Do not silently ship.

**Source material inaccessible** (paywall, 404): report the specific claims that hinge on it, flag as `cannot-verify`, recommend user supply an alternative source.

**Draft contains only opinions / forward-looking text:** report "no verifiable factual claims extracted — nothing to check" and return.
