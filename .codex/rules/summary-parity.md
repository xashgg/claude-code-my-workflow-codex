# Summary–Body Parity (anti–whack-a-mole)

**When editing any summary paragraph, do NOT apply surgical word-level fixes.** Summaries drift from their bodies when the body changes but the summary is not re-verified. Surgical edits to the flagged phrase almost always introduce a new drift elsewhere in the same paragraph.

## What counts as a "summary paragraph"

- CHANGELOG opening paragraph of a version entry (the lede before the first `###` subheading)
- README.md tagline and section ledes
- PR title and `## Summary` block
- Skill / rule / agent frontmatter `description:` field
- Guide `workflow-guide.qmd` section abstracts
- MEMORY.md `[LEARN:*]` entry headlines (the single-sentence summary before the prose)
- Any paragraph of the form "This release does X. It does not do Y. Counts are Z." — the triple-claim shape is a drift magnet

## The protocol

When you edit a summary paragraph (or when a reviewer — human, Copilot, or Codex — flags one):

1. **Read the full body** the summary is summarizing. Not just the diff. The whole thing.
2. **Enumerate every substantive claim** in the current summary: every noun list ("skills, rules, hooks"), every count, every superlative ("no new"), every inclusion/exclusion ("except X").
3. **Check each claim against the body.** For each claim, find the body content that supports or refutes it.
4. **Edit the whole paragraph, not just the flagged phrase.** Any specific claim that doesn't hold must be corrected in-place.
5. **Re-scan for orphan references.** A claim removed from the summary must not reappear in the body unreferenced, and vice versa.

## When to stop patching and rewrite

If a reviewer flags the same summary paragraph **twice in a row** (even on different words), stop patching — rewrite structurally. Two hits on the same paragraph means the paragraph itself is the wrong shape, not the specific wording.

**Rewrite bias:** prefer abstraction over specificity in summaries. A summary that makes zero enumerative claims cannot drift.

| Drift-prone (specific) | Drift-proof (abstract) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| "No new skills, no new rules, no new hooks" | "No new directories on disk" |
| "27 skills / 13 agents / 22 rules / 6 hooks" | "On-disk inventory unchanged — see README for counts" |
| "Edits to `.codex/agents/X.md` and `.codex/skills/Y/SKILL.md`" | "Existing infrastructure revised" |
| "Fixes Copilot finding #3 and Codex finding #7" | "Addresses pre-merge review" |

The specific form is more informative when fresh but more likely to rot. The abstract form stays true across edits.

## Lesson: Copilot / Codex are drift detectors

Treat repeated review-bot findings on the same paragraph as a **structural signal**, not a list of bugs to patch one at a time. Each patch narrows the drift window but doesn't close it — the next edit to the body reopens it elsewhere.

## Cross-references

- `MEMORY.md` — `[LEARN:audit]` on summary-body whack-a-mole (the originating incident: three consecutive Copilot findings on the v1.6.1 CHANGELOG opening paragraph, PRs #88–#90).
- `.codex/skills/commit/SKILL.md` — when writing the commit message for a doc-heavy PR, apply this rule to the `## Summary` section before pushing.
