# TikZ Prevention Rules

**Write TikZ that can't collide in the first place.** Complements `tikz-visual-quality.md` (general standards) and `tikz-measurement.md` (repair-time formulas). Load whenever you are authoring or editing a `\begin{tikzpicture}` block.

> Adapted from Scott Cunningham's `tikz_rules.md` in [MixtapeTools](https://github.com/scunning1975/MixtapeTools). Used with attribution.

The LaTeX compiler does **not** warn on label-over-arrow overlaps, labels crossing shape boundaries, or arrows crossing arrows. Every one of these bugs must be caught at authoring time or in review. These rules shift the catch upstream.

## Rule P1: Explicit dimensions on **boxed** nodes (MANDATORY)

Every *boxed* text-bearing node — one drawn with `draw`, `fill`, a custom node style from the TikZ styles library (e.g. `dag-node`, `flow-node`, `decision-node`), or any shape style like `rectangle`, `diamond`, `circle` with `draw`/`fill` — must declare its size explicitly. Implicit sizing means the label can grow past the box edge without anyone noticing.

```latex
% BAD — node size grows silently with text length
\node[draw, rounded corners] (X) {Pre-trends assumption};

% GOOD — explicit box; text wraps or the author notices
\node[draw, rounded corners, minimum width=3.2cm, minimum height=1.0cm,
      text width=3.0cm, align=center] (X) {Pre-trends assumption};
```

Use either:

- `minimum width` + `minimum height` — for boxes whose size should not depend on the text.
- `text width` + `align=center` (or `left`) — for boxes whose height should grow with text.

`text width` is required for any multi-line content (anything containing `\\`).

### Scope — what P1 does **not** cover

Plain labels, axis ticks, axis titles, and free-floating annotations (`\node[above] {label}`, `\node[below, font=\footnotesize] at (\x, -0.1) {\x}`, etc.) are intentionally **not** subject to P1. Forcing dimensions on them would make every axis tick a syntax burden and conflict with the snippet gallery's own usage.

For those unboxed labels, correctness is enforced by P4 (directional keywords) and by the measurement rules (gap calculation, boundary clearance) in `tikz-measurement.md`.

---

## Rule P2: Coordinate map comment (MANDATORY for ≥3 nodes)

For any diagram with three or more nodes, precede `\begin{tikzpicture}` with a comment block that lists the named coordinates and a one-line intent sentence. This is the reader's legend; it also forces the author to think in absolute coordinates rather than relative drift.

```latex
% Diagram: Confounded DAG — X caused by U, Y caused by X and U.
% Coordinates: (x, y)
%   U at (3, 2)   -- confounder, top center
%   X at (0, 0)   -- treatment, lower left
%   Y at (6, 0)   -- outcome, lower right
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node (U) at (3, 2) {U};
  ...
\end{tikzpicture}
```

---

## Rule P3: `scale=X` alone is banned — scale nodes with it

The real failure mode is **asymmetric scaling**: `scale=0.8` shrinks coordinates but *not* text. A 2 cm gap becomes 1.6 cm; the 1.2 cm label that fit before now overlaps. This silently produces the exact collisions the measurement rule exists to prevent.

**Ban.** `\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=X]` with no accompanying node scaling. This is the unsafe pattern.

**Allowed — the symmetric forms.** These scale coordinates *and* nodes together, so gap/label geometry survives:

```latex
% Full-width diagrams — recommended default in tikz-visual-quality.md
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.1, every node/.style={scale=1.1}]

% Or use transform shape to scale node contents with coordinates
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.85, transform shape]
```

When you stick to those forms, the `[scale=1.1]` convention from `tikz-visual-quality.md` is fine. When you write a bare `scale=` without node scaling, the prevention pre-check in `/extract-tikz` (Step 1) halts the pipeline.

## Rule P4: Directional keyword on every edge label

Every label attached to an edge must carry a positional keyword (`above`, `below`, `left`, `right`, or a compound). Bare `node {label}` places text *on* the arrow — reliably collides, silently compiles.

```latex
% BAD — label sits on the arrow line
\draw[->] (A) -- (B) node[midway] {confounded};

% GOOD — explicit direction
\draw[->] (A) -- (B) node[midway, above] {confounded};
```

| Arrow orientation | Preferred keyword |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Horizontal | `above` or `below` |
| Vertical | `left` or `right` |
| Diagonal | side with more whitespace |
| Curved (`bend left/right`) | `above` on the outside of the bend |

For parallel arrows, stagger labels: use `pos=0.3` on one and `pos=0.7` on the other, or alternate `above`/`below`.

## Rule P5: Use the canonical snippets

`templates/tikz-snippets/` contains verified starting points for common academic diagrams (DAG, DiD plot, event study, timeline, flowchart, supply-demand, regression scatter, mediation). Each snippet embeds rules P1–P4 and includes a coordinate map.

Preferred workflow:

1. `/new-diagram <snippet-name>` — see the `/new-diagram` skill once TX3 ships; it scaffolds from the gallery.
2. Or copy the snippet manually: `cp templates/tikz-snippets/dag-basic.tex Figures/LectureN/my-dag.tex`.
3. Edit node labels and coordinates to fit your case. **Keep the coordinate map up to date.**
4. Only then invoke `/extract-tikz` or `/compile-latex`.

Writing a novel diagram from scratch is allowed but must still satisfy P1–P4 *and* the measurement rules in `tikz-measurement.md`.

---

## Rule P6: One tikzpicture per idea

A single `\begin{tikzpicture}` should encode one idea. If you need to show a sequence (stepwise reveal of a DAG, before/after comparison), use multiple tikzpictures — one per frame or subfigure — rather than one tikzpicture overloaded with conditionals or overlay layers.

This keeps each diagram small enough that the measurement rules are tractable.

---

## Enforcement

- `/extract-tikz` runs a prevention pre-check as **Step 1** before compiling. Violations of P1 (boxed nodes only), P3 (bare `scale=`), or P4 (missing directional keyword on edge labels) halt the pipeline and report the offending block. P2 (coordinate map) and P5–P6 are reviewer concerns, not grep-checkable.
- `/new-diagram` runs the same Step 1 grep patterns before its standalone compile — both skills use identical regexes so behavior doesn't drift.
- `tikz-reviewer` cites these rules by name when reporting CRITICAL/MAJOR issues.
- Quality scoring is defined in [`quality-gates.md`](quality-gates.md). The TikZ section there deducts −5 for a label-overlap finding (which is typically the symptom of a P1/P3/P4 violation that reached production); it does **not** currently deduct per-rule. That may change — consult `quality-gates.md` for the authoritative scoring rubric.
